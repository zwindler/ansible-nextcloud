# ansible-nextcloud

Ansible playbook to deploy a Nextcloud instance on a clean 18.04 Ubuntu server (LEMP PHP7.2 stack)

## Prerequisites

A clean Ubuntu 18.04 instance with root access. If you don't have one, follow the next chapter to deploy a clean Ubuntu 18.04 instance on Scaleway (costs less than 4â‚¬ a month, payed hourly). If you already have one, skip the following "Create a VM on Scaleway" chapter.

## Create a VM on Scaleway

### Prerequisites for Scaleway VM

* Create an account in Scaleway
* Generate an SSH key pair (called admin.key and admin.pub)
* Install prerequisites system packages

```bash
sudo apt-get install python3 python3-dev python3-pip build-essential libssl-dev libffi-dev jq
```

* Install Python packages on the local machine

```bash
pip3 install jinja2 PyYAML paramiko cryptography packaging
```

* Install Ansible (ideally from sources, as it evolves really fast)

If you don't want to install it from sources, you can use the PPA (see Ansible documentation)

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install software-properties-common
sudo apt-add-repository --yes --update ppa:ansible/ansible
sudo apt install ansible
```

### Scaleway token

Create a token in Scaleway to authenticate Ansible access to the Scaleway API. In this repo, an empty environment file has been create with the name `scaleway_token`. Add you token in it and should look like this:

```bash
export SCW_API_KEY='aaaaaaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaaaaaaaaaa'
```

Source the file

```bash
source scaleway_token
```

### Create a VM

Use scaleway\_create\_vm.yaml to:

* get organisation id of the Scaleway account
* find a compatible Ubuntu image for the VM
* add the admin SSH key if necessary
* create the VM itself

```bash
ansible-playbook scaleway_create_vm.yml
```

If everything works, you should have a new VM in about 2 minutes in your Scaleway console.

Try to initiate a connection to this VM (don't forget to add your SSH key in agent or as an argument in `ssh` call)

```
ssh root@IP_found_in_console
[...]
Welcome on Ubuntu Bionic Beaver (18.04 LTS) (GNU/Linux 4.15.0-58-generic x86_64 )
```

### Install python and sudo on Scaleway instance

One issue that comes with Scaleway clean images is that they don't have neither sudo nor python, which will prevent us from using ansible. You can either install them manually, or use the following command to install them from your local machine:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i dynamic_inventory.yml -u root scaleway_install_prerequisites.yml
```

## Install Nextcloud

### DNS resolution

With the Ubuntu 18.04 available with a public IP, it's important to choose a DNS name for your future nextcloud service.

Use a DNS name provider to add a IPv4/6 A/AAAA record to map this DNS name to your server IP.

### Installation

Now that you have a working Ubuntu 18.04 available and resolvable, you can either run the installation playbook from your local machine to install on the distant server or directly from the future Ubuntu Nextcloud server.

Depending from where the playbook is run:

* If you run it directly on the future Nextcloud server, get the ` zwindler/ansible-nextcloud` repository on it.  We will use the "-i hosts\_local" parameter for `ansible-playbook`
* If you just generated a Scaleway VM (previous chapter), we can use Scaleway dynamic inventory. We will use the "-i dynamic\_inventory.yml" parameter for `ansible-playbook`
* If you run it from your current computer, please ensure that you can connect with SSH to the Nextcloud machine. We have to generate an inventory file by just adding the IP address of the distant Nextcloud server in a text file `echo "IP_found_in_console" > hosts_distant`. We will use the "-i hosts\_distant" parameter for `ansible-playbook`

Assuming that you chosed the Scaleway method, this should look like this:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i dynamic_inventory.yml nextcloud_install.yml
```

The playbook will prompt you for variables like password or DNS names. Store them for future use.

### Result

## TODO

* Automate Lets Encrypt certificate generation (ideally both HTTP and DNS challenge)
